| Aug 24 |  5:15-5:45pm   |                                                                                    I started by thinking the first coded message and I tried guessing on what some of the letters could be like but didn't make much progress |
| Aug 24 |  5:45-6:15pm   |                  I moved on to the second problem since I was stuck on the first one and for the numbers I use the ASCII since I remember that numbers have letter values so I used that and decoded most of the message now! |
| Aug 24 |  7:00-7:30pm   |                                                                            I finished the code for number two and worked on the third code which I am using binary code to decode and have made progress but not yet finished |
| Sep 1  | 11:00-11:30 am |                                                                                                  I started to write out the code for the first problem and started thinking about the if statements and what to say in those. |
| Sep 1  | 11:30-12:08 am |                                                                            Finished the first problem and onto the second one which I am half way down and thinking out how to convert the value of an integer to a character |
| Sep 2  |  3:00-3:30 pm  |                                                                                                      Still stuck on number two and trying to do two four loops and see how that works and putting the encrypted into a array. |
| Sep 2  |  3:30-4:00 pm  |                                       Moved on to number three and tried four loop and setting a string for the 8 charcters of the encrypted. Still trying to see how to put them as an integer to then put them in a string. |
| Sep 2  |  4:45-5:15 pm  |                                                                                                                   Finished number three and went back to number two for a little bit and tried doing similar to number three. |
| Sep 2  | 5:15 -5:45 pm  |                                                                                 Finished number two by plugging in an equation discussed in class and having that convert the string to an int and then setting it to a char. |
| Sep 2  |  8:00-8:30 pm  | Started to do number four but not sure how to approach it. Started with a four loop and getting the ding character to the unicode and trying to figure out how to put it to the original so from there set it to a character. |
| Sep 2  |  8:30-9:00pm   |                                                                                            Still stuck on number four and tried putting the number 45 as the shift but seems to be wrong and not sure how to fix the problem. |
